## About FundM3
We are a donation platform designed to support independent creators and projects worldwide. It integrates Farcaster Frames, allowing creators to showcase their projects by casting the frame on SocialFi, thereby enhancing visibility and engagement.

## How it works?

## Our features
- **Convenience**: Allows users to donate directly on creator or project pages, or via Warpcast frame.
- **Transparency**: The donor list displays information about donors, and transaction queries are publicly transparent.
- **Diversity**: Offers multiple ways to showcase and support projects, including exploring the marketplace and connecting via SocialFi.
- **Community Feel**: The integration of SocialFi fosters a stronger sense of community, enabling more interaction and communication between donors and creators.
